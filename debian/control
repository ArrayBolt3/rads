Description: RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter
 If there is more than X MB RAM in total, the desktop environment will be
 started.
 .
 If less than X MB RAM in total (for example, only 196 MB RAM in total), no
 desktop environment will be started.
 .
 This should be quite convenient, because users with low RAM could reduce Y MB
 and even if they sometimes wanted to configure/check something, they could
 assign 512 RAM and automagically boot into the graphical desktop. There are
 also many settings in /etc/rads.d/ (stackable) to configure this feature, so
 if you want, you can also add a lot RAM, but not boot into a desktop
 environment, or use different display managers and so on.
 .
 Most useful in virtual machines.
